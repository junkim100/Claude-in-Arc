# Claude-in-Arc
A deep patching toolkit designed to inject Anthropic's Official Claude Chrome Extension natively into Arc Browser's visual structure.

Because Arc doesn't officially support Chrome's `chrome.sidePanel` APIs natively yet, this script intercepts the extension's unpacked local files and re-wires them to run as an injected iFrame, matching Arc's aesthetic perfectly.

## Installation

This script automatically finds your active Claude Extension directory within Arc's User Data folder, safely backs up everything, and applies the injection patches. 

1. Ensure the **Official Claude Extension** is installed via the Chrome Web Store on Arc.

2. Clone or Download this repository.

3. Open Terminal, cd into this directory and run:

   ```bash
   node scripts/install.js
   ```

4. Once completed, navigate to `arc://extensions` in Arc.

5. Click the **Reload** button on the "Claude in Arc v0.1" extension.

6. Refresh any open tabs.

7. Use `Cmd+E` or the extension icon to toggle the panel!

## Uninstallation / Revert to Official

The installer always creates a `_backup` directory of the unmodified official extension before injecting files.
To revert, simply go to your extensions folder (`~/Library/Application Support/Arc/User Data/Default/Extensions/fcoeoabgfenejglbffodgkkbkcdhcgfn`), delete the latest patched version folder, and rename `1.0.xx_x_backup` back to `1.0.xx_x`. Reload the extension in Arc, and you are back to vanilla.
